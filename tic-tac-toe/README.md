## Tic Tac Toe

This is a simple implementation of Tic Tac Toe in Python. 

You're expected to implement the `HumanStrategy` class to beat the computer.

Specifically, you're expected to implement the `get_move` method. 

The `get_move` method should take a board as input and return a tuple of the form `(i, j)` where `i` and `j` are the row and column of the move you want to make.

The board is a 3x3 grid, and the possible values of the pieces are in the `Piece` enum ('X', 'O', ' '). The board is represented as a list of lists, where each inner list represents a row.


### Running the program

```bash
python3 run_simulation.py
```

### Running the program with verbose output

```
